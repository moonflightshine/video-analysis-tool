		<h1>Data Track</h1>
		<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/particle.gif" alt="Data track steps"></p>

		<p>A <strong>data track</strong> is a set of one or more <a href="pointmass.html">point masses</a> with world positions determined by an external <strong>data source</strong>, typically based on a dynamic model. It enables the model to be animated and drawn directly on a real-world video for visual comparison.  Note: when comparing  data with a video it is important that the model time steps match  the video frame rate. For example, to compare data with a 100 fps video the time steps should be 0.01 s.</p>
		<p>There are two types of data source:</p>
		<ol>
	  	  <li><strong><a href="#delimited">Delimited text data</a></strong> in a <strong>file</strong> or copied to the system <strong>clipboard</strong> in a separate program (e.g., spreadsheet).</li>
	  	  <li>An <a href="#ejss"><strong>EjsS</strong> <strong>simulation</strong></a> or other program able to send data directly to Tracker.</li>
    </ol>
	<p>To create a data track from a delimited text data <strong>file</strong>, do one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Click the <strong>Create</strong> button <img src="../help_images/create_button.gif" align="absmiddle"> and choose <strong>Data Track|Open Data Source...</strong>, then open the  file using the  file chooser.</li>
      <li>Choose <strong>File|Import|Data Source...</strong>, then open the  file using the  file chooser. </li>
    </ul>
<h3></h3>
    <p>To create a data track from delimited text data on the <strong>clipboard</strong>, do one of the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose <strong>Edit|Paste Data</strong>.</li>
      <li> Click the <strong>Create</strong> button <img src="../help_images/create_button.gif" align="absmiddle"> and choose <strong>Data Track|Paste Data</strong>.</li>
      <li> Click the <strong>Create</strong> button <img src="../help_images/create_button.gif" align="absmiddle"> and check the<strong> Data Track|Paste Data Automatically</strong> checkbox. Tracker will constantly monitor the clipboard contents and paste valid data automatically. If the clipboard data changes, the new data is immediately applied to the existing Data Track. This makes it easy to change a model in a separate application, copy its data to the clipboard, and automatically see the changes in Tracker.</li>
    </ul>
<h3></h3>
    <p>To create a data track from an EjsS simulation (version 5.2 or later), do one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Run the EjsS simulation and send data directly to Tracker.    </li>
      <li> Click the <strong>Create</strong> button <img src="../help_images/create_button.gif" align="absmiddle"> and choose <strong>Data Track|Open Data Source...</strong>, then open the jar file containing the EjsS simulation using the  file chooser.</li>
    </ul>
<h3><a name="delimited"></a>1. Data sources: delimited text data</h3>
    <p>The figure below shows three examples of delimited text data suitable for a data track. Note that:</p>
    <ul>
   	  <li>Data and variable names are organized into rows and columns. </li>
      	<li>The very first row may define an optional track name. Names should not contain spaces or punctuation marks. Underscores (&quot;_&quot;) are converted to spaces in a track name.</li>
   	  <li>A row defining  variable names must come before the first data row. At least one matched pair of x and y-variables is required (names must start or end with x and y, be otherwise identical, and be in adjacent columns). Multiple x-y pairs define multiple point masses; optional strings that are part of the x-y variable names are used to identify the points in Tracker. For example, in the &quot;jumper&quot; data, points are defined for the head, elbow and knee.</li>
   	  <li>Time &quot;t&quot; is optional. When no time data is included, Tracker uses the video frame times.</li>
   	  <li>Every data row defines a separate data point. Data points must contain values in the same order as the variables are defined. Values may be null as shown in the jumper data below.</li>
      	<li>Names or values in a given row are separated (&quot;delimited&quot;) by tabs, spaces, commas or semicolons. You must use the same delimiter throughout.</li>
   	  <li>Data values can be written in decimal or scientific format. The numbers &quot;-6&quot;, &quot;3.14&quot; and &quot;9.5E-2&quot; are all valid values.      </li>
    </ul>

      </p>
	<p>Most programs that collect, generate or analyze data, including spreadsheets, are able to copy and save (or export) delimited text data that conform to these specifications.</p>

	<h3><a name="ejss"></a>2. Data sources: EjsS simulations</h3>
	<p>EjsS  (Easy Java/Javascript Simulations) is a free authoring tool written in Java that helps non-programmers create   interactive simulations for teaching and   learning. EJsS was created by <a href="http://www.um.es/fem/EjsWiki/Main/Author" target="_blank">Francisco Esquembre</a> and, along with Tracker, is part of the <a href="http://www.opensourcephysics.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Open Source Physics</a> project. EjsS can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.um.es/fem/EjsWiki/Main/Download" target="_blank">http://www.um.es/fem/EjsWiki/Main/Download</a>.</p>
		<p>Starting with EjsS version 5.2, simulations can send data directly to Tracker where it is displayed as a data track. In addition, video and Tracker files can be loaded into Tracker directly from EjsS. This greatly increases the potential for comparing dynamic models with videos.</p>
		<p>For more information about creating simulations and sending data from EjsS, see the <a href="http://www.um.es/fem/EjsWiki/Main/HomePage" target="_blank">EjsS Wiki</a> help pages.</p>
<h3>3. Data track properties</h3>
        <p>Since the data source usually provides data generated by a theoretical model, a data track is treated as a type of <a href="particles.html">particle model</a>. For this reason it's user-controlled properties are displayed and edited using the Model Builder tool. To use the builder, choose <strong>Model Builder...</strong> from the data track's <a href="tracks.html#trackmenu">track menu</a>.</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="../help_images/datatrack_model_builder.gif" alt=""></p>
        <p>Data points loaded from a data source are stored in a data point array. Each data point can be referred to by its index (starting from 0) in the array. For example, in the &quot;launched_marble&quot; delimited text data example above the array would have a length of 11 with indices from 0 to 10. The data point at index 10 would have the value (t=1.0, x=5.0, y=-10.0).</p>
    <p>The following properties are user-settable in the model builder:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start Frame: the video frame displaying the first data point.</li>
          <li>Frame Count: the number of video frames displaying data points.</li>
          <li>Data Start: the index of the first displayed data points.</li>
          <li>Data Stride: the index increment between displayed data points.</li>
          <li>Time Basis: the source of the time base used to determine video frame times (and thus velocities and accelerations). Data Time is enabled only if a data source provides time data.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>For example, using the settings shown in the figure above, data point index 2 is displayed in video frame 15, index 4 in frame 16, index 6 in frame 17, index 8 in frame 18 and index 10 in frame 19 as shown in the green and white bar graphics. In this example, the data time is ignored since video time is selected as the time basis.</p>

<h3>4. Data track point and line properties</h3>
        <p>The points defined by a data track are <a href="pointmass.html">point masses</a> so each has settable mass, color, footprint and motion vector properties. This also means you can attach measuring tools to the points and add them to center of mass tracks just like any other point mass track.</p>
        <p>When a data track defines two or more points you can connect them with lines using the <strong>Lines</strong> item in the data track's menu. With three or more points choose <strong>Close</strong> to connect the last point back to the first.</p>
